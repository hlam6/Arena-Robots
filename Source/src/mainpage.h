/*! \mainpage CSCI3081 Robot Simulator Project
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This program is a visual representation of an arena with entities inside. The entities in the arena include a robot, which is player controlled, a home base, a recharge station, and several immobile obstacles; the home base and the robot can move. The robot is controlled with arrow keys, and has its battery level displayed on the GUI. 

The objective of the game is for the player to collide their robot with the home base. If they do, they win the game. If the robot runs out of battery before colliding with the robot, they lose the game. To circumvent this, the player can move their robot into a recharge station, which refills the battery level completely. If the player robot collides into any of the immobile obstacles, they lose 10% of their battery and slow down.
